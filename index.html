        <h1 class="intro">You are being sent on a mission to retrieve one of the most powerful objects in all of Arata, the S.T.U.P.I.D. (the Scientific Technology by the Underrated Professional Intelligent Doctor). Unfortunately, the S.T.U.P.I.D. was lost ages ago in all out war in the lands of Arata and was never seen again. However, recently, technology built by the Magic Order has pinpointed the location of the S.T.U.P.I.D. and you, young traveler, have been trusted upon to retrieve this item and bring glory for your kingdom or organization in the years to come.
</h1>
<h1 class="intro" id="cont1">continue</h1>
<h1 class="choose1">The place that the Magic Order has pinpointed the S.T.U.P.I.D. to be is in an abandoned dungeon located in the east of Arata. You have just recently arrived at the entrance. Before you arrived at the entrance you noticed that there was a back entrance to the dungeon. The back entrance was quite simply a wooden door while the front entrance of the dungeon is as large as a castle gate. Would you like to continue or go through the back entrance?</h1>
<h2 class="choose1" id="1">>Go through main entrance</h2>
<h2 class="choose1" id="2">>Go through back entrance</h2>
<h1 class="option1">You go through the main entrance to see a long corridor that leads somewhere. With nowhere else to go, you follow the corridor down to the end and you are given a choice of going to the left or to the right. On the wall at the end of the corridor there sits a sign that says: “To go to the left or to the right? To the left where nothing is right or to the right where nothing is left.”
</h1>
<h1 class="option1" id="1-1">>Go Left</h1>
<h1 class="option1" id="1-2">>Go Right</h1>
<h1 class="option1-1">You proceeded to go left and you found yourself in a room where everything is inverted. You feel nauseous from the room but you proceed. As you continue, you feel something is behind you and you turn around only to see your shadow. You calm yourself down and turn back around only to see yourself face to face with a ghoul. Before you can scream, you get ripped to pieces by the ghoul.</h1>

<p class="option1-1" id="restart3">>Main Menu</p>
<h1 class="option1-2">You go to the right and you find yourself in a room with corpses and skeletons. You wonder what has happened to them but you keep walking. As you keep walking, you see more and more corpses and skeletons laying on the ground. As you are busy taking in your surroundings, you run into a wall. A rather scaly wall. Wait....this isnt a wall at all...... IT'S A DRAGON'S LEG. You start panicking and you try to run only to wake up the dragon. Now you must fight him.</h1>

<h1 class="option2">You go down the back entrance where there is a set of stairs. You decide to go down the stairs and it leads you to a room where you are surrounded by various sets of armor,  weapons and staffs on the ground. There is an entrance to go to the next room but the gear that surrounds you is much better than the ones you have now. You are tempted to take this gear, but you don’t know if there are any consequences.</h1>
<h1 class="option2" id="2-1">>Take gear</h1>
<h1 class="option2" id="2-2">>Leave the Gear</h1>
<h1 class="option2-1">After taking the gear from the ground, the floor beneath you gives way and you fall down a giant pit, only to land on spikes. Your body is then crushed as the ceiling crashes down ontop of you.</h1>

<p class="option2-1" id="restart1">>Main Menu</p>
<h1 class="option2-2">You have left the gear and entered into the new room. As you absorb the sights of your surroundings, you realize you are in the backrooms. Due to how dangerous the backrooms are, you start freaking out. You dont know if you will make it out alive. There seems to be a noise as though someone is walking closer and closer to you. The footsteps get even closer and you turn around to see GIGA CHAD CHASING YOU DOWN in the backrooms. You try to run but you stumble and giga chad catches up to you. You are about to scream for help but giga chad quiets you down and says he is only here to spread his wisdom about life and gave you a motivational speech. Then both you and giga chad leave the dungeon to spread more of Giga Chad's wisdom.</h1>
